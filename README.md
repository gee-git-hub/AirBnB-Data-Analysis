## Overview

The **Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization** project is an extensive effort focused on data exploration and presentation. This project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, and the development of an interactive Streamlit user interface. Its primary goal is to deliver insights and make Airbnb data more comprehensible and accessible.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered Airbnb data from various sources, including MongoDB.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for thorough analysis.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Converted data from MongoDB into structured DataFrames.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted detailed analysis and visualization of Airbnb data.
- **Interactive Streamlit UI**: Developed a user-friendly interface for data exploration and presentation.
- **PowerBI Dashboard**: Created an engaging and interactive dashboard with dynamic filters.

## Methods

- **Data Collection**: Utilized web scraping, API access, and database queries to obtain data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Employed techniques for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **ETL Work**: Extracted data from MongoDB and transformed it into structured formats using Pandas.
- **EDA**: Applied visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data exploration.
- **Streamlit UI**: Used the Streamlit library to build an interactive web application.
- **PowerBI**: Developed dashboards and visualizations to present data effectively.
